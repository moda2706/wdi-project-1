#Intro



"Have you ever wanted to smack our idiotic leaders in the face? Well now you can!"

Whack a D!cktator is a state of the art, mind blowing, one of kind game that will give you the thrills you seek (NOT REALLY!) by smacking the day light of our peace loving leaders

##Inspiration 

The inspiration for this game was a semi- agressive attack on all the dictators around the world that give mankind a bad name ```Bar King Obama ```


##Highs
The main high was getting the game actually working and thinking at the beginning of the week how ``` impossibe ``` it was but in fact realising that it can be done. 

##Highs
This was my first ever game and although it's working and is styled, I still feel I have a lot to learn.By the time I go into my second project, my confidence will be higher ``` :) ```
 
##Technologies used
 I used vailla javascript and css for this project. 
 
###Things I would like to add
I would like to add levels to this game and also lives.
